## Personal Reflection on Core Values

### Humility
This sprint taught me the importance of building robust, well-tested systems. While implementing the coach feedback component, I focused on creating clean, maintainable code rather than rushing to completion. I recognized that thorough testing and proper error handling are essential for team integration, even when working under tight deadlines.

### Gratitude  
I'm grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this collaborative sprint. Working on the feedback scoring system allowed me to develop both technical skills and appreciation for systematic software development. The comprehensive testing framework we built will benefit the entire team's integration efforts.

### Honesty
I maintained transparency throughout development by documenting all implementation details, test results, and integration points. When challenges arose with database schema design, I addressed them directly rather than implementing quick fixes. This honest approach ensured our component meets all sprint requirements and team standards.
